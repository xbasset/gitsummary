technical_highlights:
- Updates AGENTS.md to show repeated use of the --tag option (`--tag v0.1.0 --tag
  v0.2.0`) instead of a single option followed by two values, aligning docs with the
  actual CLI interface.
- Introduces docs/project_summary.md as a high-level design document outlining the
  concept of semantic artifacts, their facets (context, intention, implementation,
  impact, maintainability, deployment, meta), and how they are stored using Git Notes.
- Documents intended CLI workflows for `gitsummary collect` and `gitsummary analyze`,
  including interactive analysis and facet-targeted analysis.
- Clarifies long-term strategy and philosophy for the project, serving as architectural
  and product direction rather than executable behavior.
