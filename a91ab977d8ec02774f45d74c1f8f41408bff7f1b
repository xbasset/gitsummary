schema_version: 0.1.0
intent_summary: Replaces a minimal TODO note with a detailed, ordered work plan for
  the gitsummary project and removes now-redundant specification discussion documents.
category: chore
behavior_before: null
behavior_after: null
impact_scope: docs
is_breaking: false
technical_highlights:
- Expanded docs/TODO.md from a short placeholder into a 13-step sequential project
  plan covering problem grounding, schema design, storage layout, CLI design, implementation,
  testing, docs, packaging, and dogfooding.
- Removed workdir/spec-open-questions.md, which previously captured a large set of
  unresolved design questions; these are implicitly superseded or assumed to be resolved/handled
  by the new work plan.
- No code, APIs, or configuration were changed—only documentation and planning artifacts
  were updated and reorganized.
