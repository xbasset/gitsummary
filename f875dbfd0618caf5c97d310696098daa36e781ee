  and a comprehensive set of shared fixtures and initial CLI formatter tests for the

technical_highlights:
- Adds a pytest.ini configuration that scopes tests to the tests/ directory, uses
  test_*.py naming, and enables verbose output with short tracebacks while suppressing
  DeprecationWarning noise.
- Introduces requirements-dev.txt to separate development dependencies, including
  pytest and pytest-cov, with commented-out optional tools (ruff, mypy).
- Creates a rich tests/conftest.py providing reusable pytest fixtures for CommitInfo,
  CommitDiff, CommitArtifact, ExtractionResult objects, and lists of these, modeling
  many realistic commit scenarios (feature, fix, breaking, security, docs, chore,
  docs-only diffs, test-only diffs, etc.).
- Adds tests/test_cli_formatters.py to validate CLI formatter functions (human, brief,
  JSON, YAML, status) against the core domain models, ensuring correct inclusion and
  formatting of fields like short SHA, intent summary, category, impact scope, and
  breaking status.
- Uses type annotations and __future__.annotations for forward references in test
  code, keeping tests type-hint friendly without impacting runtime behavior.
