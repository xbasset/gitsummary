intent_summary: Remove outdated OpenAI Responses API implementation details from the
  architecture docs and TODO notes, keeping documentation provider-agnostic and current.

is_breaking: false
technical_highlights:
- Eliminates a TODO implementation note that specifically referenced `beta.chat.completions.parse()`
  for schema conformance, reducing coupling of docs to a particular OpenAI API variant.
- Removes a dedicated section describing the OpenAI Responses API (including parameter
  and field mappings and default model) from the step-9 architecture document, likely
  because it is outdated or no longer aligned with the intended provider abstraction.
- Keeps references to the new `gitsummary/llm/` package and Strategy + Factory pattern,
  indicating the architecture remains but without low-level OpenAI API specifics.
