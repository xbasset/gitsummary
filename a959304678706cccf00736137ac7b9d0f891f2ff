intent_summary: Refines LLM provider initialization so that when a model override
  is specified, a ProviderConfig is created and populated with an API key from the
  configuration manager, while otherwise deferring configuration to the provider registry.
category: feature
behavior_before: _get_llm_provider always instantiated an empty ProviderConfig and
  only optionally set the model field; API keys were not explicitly fetched or injected
  here, and default configuration handling by the registry/config manager could be
  bypassed by the always-present config object.
behavior_after: _get_llm_provider now passes no config when no model override is given
  (letting the registry/config manager fully handle configuration and API keys), and
  when a model override is provided it creates a ProviderConfig with that model and
  attempts to fetch and set the provider-specific API key via get_config_manager before
  calling get_provider.

technical_highlights:
- Introduces use of get_config_manager from the llm package to centralize API key
  retrieval for providers.
- Changes ProviderConfig construction from an always-instantiated empty object to
  a conditional Optional[ProviderConfig] that is only created when a model override
  is supplied.
- When a model is specified, the function now fetches an API key via config_manager.get_api_key(provider_name,
  prompt_if_missing=False) and assigns it to config.api_key if present, ensuring explicit
  configs still carry credentials.
- If no model is provided, the function now passes None as the config to get_provider,
  allowing the provider registry/config manager to inject configuration and API keys
  automatically.
- Improves import structure by using a multi-line import that includes get_config_manager
  alongside get_provider and list_available_providers.
