intent_summary: Add a comprehensive automated test suite covering the ReleaseNote
  data models, LLM-related schemas, infrastructure helpers, and reporter service behavior,
  including serialization, validation, and error-handling paths for release notes
  generation.

technical_highlights:
- Introduces pytest-based unit tests for all Pydantic models in gitsummary.core.release_note,
  including SourceCommit, ReleaseNoteMetadata, ReleaseNoteHeader, Highlight, Feature,
  Improvement, BugFix, Deprecation, KnownIssue, CallToAction, and ReleaseNote.
- Validates default values and optional fields on models (e.g., default generator_version,
  empty commits lists, optional deadlines and URLs).
- Adds tests for YAML serialization/deserialization via ReleaseNote.to_yaml() and
  ReleaseNote.from_yaml(), including round-trip integrity, minimal vs fully populated
  objects, and datetime ISO formatting compatibility with yaml.safe_load.
- Covers JSON serialization using model_dump(mode="json") to ensure fields are correctly
  emitted for downstream consumers.
- Exercises validation constraints such as allowed Highlight.type values and rejection
  of invalid types via Pydantic validation errors.
- (From commit message, though not fully shown in diff) adds tests for infrastructure
  functions (save_release_note, load_release_note, release_note_exists) and for the
  reporter service’s generate_llm_release_notes() behavior, including heuristic mode,
  mocked LLM provider integration, fallback behavior, and artifact preparation for
  LLM synthesis.
- Adds tests for LLM release note schema models and prompt/artifact formatting to
  ensure the structures passed to LLMs conform to expected schemas.
