# Release notes

This directory is optional and may be unused in CI automation.

- CI automation can generate release notes via `gitsummary ci release-notes ...` and upload the markdown as a workflow artifact.
- Git Notes (`refs/notes/intent`) remain the canonical store for per-commit artifacts when pushed/fetched.
