intent_summary: Improve readability and clarity of documentation and internal Python
  code formatting without changing runtime behavior or public interfaces.

impact_scope: docs
is_breaking: false
technical_highlights:
- README.md is rewritten to provide a more narrative, marketing-style introduction
  and corrects the example CLI usage from `gitsummary collect --tag v0.1.0 v0.2.0`
  to `gitsummary collect --tag v0.1.0 --tag v0.2.0`, clarifying that both arguments
  are tags.
- The long project specification document at docs/spec.md is removed from the repository,
  indicating a cleanup or consolidation of design documentation.
- 'Python functions in gitsummary/artifact.py are reformatted for clarity: long parameter
  lists and complex expressions are split across multiple lines, and regex construction
  is wrapped for readability, but logic and data flow remain identical.'
- The deployment section’s configuration file detection and logging change counting
  keep the same conditions and regex, only reformatted, so analyzer behavior is unchanged.
- The symbol detection regex in _detect_symbols is preserved exactly while being split
  across lines, maintaining the same matching semantics.
