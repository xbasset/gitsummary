intent_summary: Refactors release note modeling and rendering into dedicated report
  and renderer modules, introduces a new `report` CLI namespace that aliases existing
  generate commands, and splits LLM prompt helpers while keeping backward-compatible
  wrappers.

technical_highlights:
- Moves the `ReleaseNote` schema out of `gitsummary.core` into a new `reports` package
  (`...reports import ReleaseNote`), decoupling release-note reporting from core commit
  models.
- Extracts markdown/text formatting logic for changelog, impact, and release notes
  from `cli.commands.generate` into a centralized `renderers` module, and updates
  call sites in both `generate` and `show` commands to use these helpers.
- Adds a new Typer sub-application `report` in `cli.app` and wires its `changelog`,
  `release-notes`, and `impact` commands as aliases to the existing `generate` commands,
  providing a unified, preferred entrypoint without removing the old one.
- Removes `ReleaseNote` and related types from `gitsummary.core.__init__.__all__`,
  signaling that release-note models are no longer part of the core public surface
  and should be accessed via the reports layer instead.
- Updates documentation to point to the new `reports/release_notes/model.py` location
  for `ReleaseNote` and to the split LLM prompt/schema modules (`prompts_release_note.py`,
  `schemas_release_note.py`).
- Replaces inline markdown construction for impact and changelog reports with calls
  to `format_impact_markdown` and `format_changelog_markdown`, improving reuse and
  separation of concerns.
- Keeps `gitsummary.llm.prompts` as a thin compatibility wrapper that re-exports prompt
  builders from more focused modules, easing migration for existing integrations.
