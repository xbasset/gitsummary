intent_summary: Introduce the initial gitsummary Python package and Typer-based CLI
  that collects git metadata into JSON artifacts and analyzes them via pluggable facet
  renderers, along with basic docs and storage layout.
category: feature
behavior_before: null
behavior_after: 'After this change, running `python -m gitsummary` (or `gitsummary`
  if wired as a console script) provides three main commands: `version` prints the
  CLI version; `collect --tag <A> <B>` validates the two tags, computes the commit
  range, gathers commits, file changes, diff stats and patch via git, builds a structured
  artifact describing context, intention, implementation, impact, maintainability,
  and deployment, and persists it under `.gitsummary/artifacts/<ARTIFACT_ID>.json`;
  and `analyze <ARTIFACT_ID> --target <facet>` loads a stored artifact by ID or unambiguous
  prefix and prints the selected facet (e.g., `implementation`) as pretty-printed
  JSON, with clear error messages for invalid tags, missing/ambiguous artifacts, or
  unknown targets.'

technical_highlights:
- Defines `gitsummary` as a Python package with `__version__` and exposes the Typer
  app via `__all__` and a `__main__.py` entry point so it can be run with `python
  -m gitsummary`.
- Implements a Typer-based CLI (`cli.py`) with subcommands `version`, `collect`, and
  `analyze`, including argument/option validation, colored error output, and non-zero
  exit codes on failures.
- Introduces a `StorageLayout`-based artifact storage convention rooted at `<repo>/.gitsummary`,
  abstracted behind `_artifact_layout()` so all commands share the same on-disk layout.
- Adds an `artifact.build_artifact` pipeline that takes a commit range, commit list,
  file changes, diff stats, and raw diff text and constructs a multi-section artifact
  (`context`, `intention`, `implementation`, `impact`, `maintainability`, `deployment`,
  `meta`).
- Uses an `ArtifactContext` dataclass to derive higher-level context such as authors,
  commit summaries, and ISO8601 date ranges from the raw commit list.
- Implements heuristic classification in `_section_intention`, inferring a domain
  (documentation, infrastructure, maintainability, or feature) from keywords in the
  latest commit summary.
- Computes implementation details such as changed file paths, LOC added/removed, top
  file extensions, and symbol-level changes by regex-parsing the diff for added/removed
  `def`/`class`/`function`/`module`/`interface` declarations.
- Adds simple impact, maintainability, and deployment heuristics by scanning the diff
  text for keywords (e.g., schema/migration/database, TODO/FIXME, logging calls, config
  filenames) and deriving risk levels, scores, and configuration touches.
- Provides an `analyzers` module that registers facet analyzers in a dictionary keyed
  by target name (context, intention, implementation, impact, maintainability, deployment)
  and returns pretty-printed JSON for each section, with a defensive error path for
  unknown targets.
- Documents project usage and conventions via new `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`, including
  how to install dependencies, run the CLI, expected artifact locations, coding style,
  and testing guidelines.
