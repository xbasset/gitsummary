intent_summary: Update development testing dependency version and remove testing tools
  from the main runtime requirements file so they are only used in the dev environment.

technical_highlights:
- Bumped pytest-cov version constraint in requirements-dev.txt from '>=4.0.0' to '>=5.0.0',
  aligning dev testing tools with a newer major release.
- Removed pytest and pytest-cov entries (and their comment header) from requirements.txt
  so they are no longer installed as part of the production/runtime dependency set.
- Kept pytest listed only in requirements-dev.txt, clearly separating dev/test dependencies
  from runtime dependencies.
tool_version: 0.1.0
