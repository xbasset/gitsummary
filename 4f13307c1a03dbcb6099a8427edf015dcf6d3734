intent_summary: Introduce trailing blank lines at the end of several source and test
  files, likely to satisfy style or tooling requirements, without changing runtime
  behavior or tests’ logic.

technical_highlights:
- 'Only whitespace changes were made: two newline characters appended to the end of
  multiple Python modules and test files.'
- No functions, classes, signatures, or logic were modified; imports and public APIs
  remain identical.
- The change likely targets linting/formatting or coverage tooling expectations rather
  than functional behavior.
