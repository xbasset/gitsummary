intent_summary: Rearchitects the gitsummary CLI around a Typer application, factors
  artifact construction and analysis into dedicated modules, exposes version/app metadata,
  and adds user-facing documentation for the CLI workflow.
category: feature
behavior_before: The CLI was implemented as a large argparse-based script in gitsummary.cli,
  with git interaction, artifact construction, and storage layout all tightly coupled;
  the package exposed a main() entry point, there was no structured analyzers/artifact
  module, no explicit __version__, and no README describing how to use the CLI or
  its subcommands.
behavior_after: The CLI is now organized as a Typer app exposed as gitsummary.cli.app
  and invoked via a small __main__.py wrapper; artifact construction is handled by
  a dedicated build_artifact() function in gitsummary.artifact, analyzers for different
  artifact facets are centralized in gitsummary.analyzers with a registry and run()
  helper, the package exposes __version__ and app at the top level, and a README documents
  installation and usage of collect/analyze/version commands and the artifact semantics.
impact_scope: public_api
is_breaking: true
technical_highlights:
- Replaces the previous monolithic argparse-based CLI implementation in gitsummary.cli
  with a Typer-based architecture, where the Typer application object is defined in
  cli.py and imported as app.
- Introduces gitsummary.__init__ metadata, defining __version__ = '0.1.0' and exporting
  app, changing the public surface from main() to app and version, which external
  callers can import.
- Refactors the module entry point in gitsummary.__main__ to import app and define
  a thin main() wrapper that simply calls app(), simplifying the console entry path
  for `python -m gitsummary`.
- Adds a new gitsummary.analyzers package that defines a simple Analyzer type alias,
  several facet-specific analyzer functions (context, intention, implementation, impact,
  maintainability, deployment), and a registry dict used by available_targets() and
  run() to dispatch analysis by target string.
- 'Implements a new gitsummary.artifact module that encapsulates artifact construction:
  it defines an ArtifactContext dataclass to derive authors, summary, and date_range
  from a commit sequence, and a build_artifact() function that assembles a v0.1-spec
  artifact dict with context, intention, implementation, impact, maintainability,
  deployment, and meta sections.'
- 'Uses lightweight heuristics in artifact sections: intention infers a domain (documentation,
  infrastructure, maintainability, feature) from the latest commit message; implementation
  computes changed files, LOC added/removed, top file extensions, and symbol changes
  via regex-based _detect_symbols; impact/maintainability/deployment sections use
  regexes over diff text to infer risk, test additions, technical debt markers, configuration
  touches, and logging changes.'
- Introduces a README.md that documents installation via pip + `python -m gitsummary`,
  describes the collect and analyze workflows, explains artifact storage under .gitsummary/artifacts,
  and documents the version command and development philosophy.
- Adopts __future__.annotations in new/modified modules to enable postponed evaluation
  of type hints and uses typing aliases (e.g., Mapping[str, object]) for clearer analyzer
  and artifact interfaces.
