intent_summary: Update the project specification to commit to using the Typer framework
  for the CLI and append a detailed decisions log describing the gitsummary POC design
  and behavior.

technical_highlights:
- Explicitly selects Typer as the Python CLI framework in the spec, replacing the
  previously unspecified CLI framework note.
- Adds a comprehensive decisions log section to the spec that defines POC CLI commands
  (`collect`, `analyze`), their arguments, and output semantics.
- Documents the artifact data model, including fields like context, intention, implementation,
  impact, maintainability, deployment, meta, and alias.
- Specifies a filesystem-based storage layout under `.gitsummary/` with artifacts,
  manifests by range, an index, schema versioning, and reserved notes.
- Defines artifact identity as a SHA-256 hash of the artifact JSON content, with Git-like
  prefix matching semantics.
- Clarifies ignore behavior using `.gitignore` plus an optional `.gitsummaryignore`
  with default noise patterns.
- Describes analyzer architecture (built-in analyzers, one facet per run, stdout output)
  and future plugin readiness.
- Establishes versioning rules (schema SemVer starting at 0.1.0) and metadata expectations
  (tool version, timestamps, confidence scores).
- Captures UX expectations such as Typer-based CLI, stdout-focused analysis, behavior
  when no commits are in range, and error style.
- Outlines future Git-native directions (refs, notes, push behavior) as non-POC, forward-looking
  design constraints.
