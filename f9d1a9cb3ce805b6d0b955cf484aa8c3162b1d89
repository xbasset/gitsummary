intent_summary: Update the gitsummary specification document to describe a filesystem-based
  `.gitsummary/` storage layout, rename the artifact identifier to `ART_OID`, and
  clarify how artifacts are produced and analyzed in the POC versus future Git-native
  plans.

technical_highlights:
- Replaces the previous Git-native storage design (blob OIDs, custom refs, notes,
  GC safety) with a POC-oriented design that stores artifacts and metadata under a
  `.gitsummary/` directory in the working tree.
- 'Defines a concrete directory layout: `.gitsummary/artifacts/<ART_OID>.json`, `manifests/by-range/<A>..<B>.json`,
  `index/latest.json`, `schema/version`, and reserved `notes/` subdirectory.'
- Clarifies that `<ART_OID>` is the SHA-256 hash of the artifact JSON content, with
  serialization currently using natural `json.dumps` and no strict determinism requirements
  in the POC.
- 'Adjusts CLI examples and text to consistently use `ART_OID` instead of `ARTIFACT_ID`
  and updates output messages to `Artifact created: <ART_OID>`.'
- Documents that intention and implementation sections are inferred via LLM reasoning
  and diff/heuristics only, explicitly stating that no AST parsing or traversal is
  involved.
- Updates data collection description to state that `blame` is collected by default
  and that `collect` currently operates between two tags, with broader Git reference
  support deferred.
- Introduces an explicit separation between the current POC storage approach and a
  future Git-native roadmap, noting that refs/notes/GC-safety mechanisms are future
  work rather than part of the initial scope.
