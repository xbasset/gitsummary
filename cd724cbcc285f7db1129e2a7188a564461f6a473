intent_summary: Update the default OpenAI LLM model and related documentation from
  gpt-4o-2024-08-06 to gpt-5.1 and adjust structured-output model listings accordingly.
category: chore
behavior_before: The OpenAI provider factory used `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` as the default
  model, CLI help text referenced that model as an example, and the OpenAI provider
  docs and STRUCTURED_OUTPUT_MODELS list included `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` as a structured-output
  model option.
behavior_after: The OpenAI provider factory now defaults to `gpt-5.1`, CLI help text
  uses `gpt-5.1` as the example model, the docs describe `gpt-5.1` as the default/latest
  model, and the structured-output models list no longer mentions `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`
  but redundantly includes `gpt-5.1` twice.

technical_highlights:
- Changed the default `model` parameter in `create_openai_provider_function` from
  `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` to `gpt-5.1`, affecting callers that rely on the default without
  specifying a model explicitly.
- Updated the CLI `--model` option help string in `analyze.py` to use `gpt-5.1` as
  the example provider-specific model name, aligning user-facing guidance with the
  new default.
- Adjusted OpenAI provider documentation comments to list `gpt-5.1` as the default
  and removed `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` from the supported models docstring.
- Modified `STRUCTURED_OUTPUT_MODELS` in `OpenAIProvider` to remove `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`
  and (likely unintentionally) add a duplicate `gpt-5.1` entry, which is harmless
  at runtime if treated as a set but indicates a minor list-definition oversight.
