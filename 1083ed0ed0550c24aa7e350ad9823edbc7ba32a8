intent_summary: Remove the deprecated `report` CLI subcommand while updating README
  and getting_started docs to reflect current release-notes, impact, and show behaviors,
  including Git Notes storage.
category: chore
behavior_before: The CLI exposed both `generate` and a `report` subapp, where `report`
  acted as an alias entrypoint for `changelog`, `release-notes`, and `impact` generation.
  Documentation did not clearly describe impact generation, Git Notes storage for
  release notes, or the ability of `show` to display stored reports, and still referenced
  early-development status.
behavior_after: The `report` subapp is no longer available; users must use `generate`
  for `changelog`, `release-notes`, and `impact`. Documentation now describes `generate
  impact`, clarifies that release notes are LLM-based by default and can be stored
  in Git Notes with `--store`, explains `show release-note <rev>` for stored notes,
  and updates project status and CLI descriptions accordingly.

technical_highlights:
- Removed the `report_app` Typer sub-application from `gitsummary/cli/app.py`, including
  its registration on the root app and all `report` subcommands that aliased `generate`
  commands.
- Kept the `generate` and `show` Typer sub-apps as the sole entrypoints for report
  generation and display, preserving existing `generate changelog`, `generate release-notes`,
  `generate impact`, and `show release-note` commands.
- Updated README examples to emphasize `generate release-notes` with `--store`, introduce
  `generate impact`, and document `show release-note <rev>` for retrieving stored
  release notes from Git Notes.
- Clarified in docs that `show` can display both artifacts and stored reports, and
  documented that release notes are stored under `refs/notes/report/release-note`
  when `--store` is used.
- Adjusted project status messaging from early design to active development and consolidated
  documentation pointers to `project_summary.md` and `cli_design.md`.
