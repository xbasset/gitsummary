# **gitsummary — Let Your Codebase Explain Itself**

Every developer knows the feeling: you open a repo you haven't touched in months—or one you’ve never seen. The commit messages are vague (“fix”, “update”, “wip”), the PR history is scattered across hosting platforms, and the diffs tell you *what* changed but never *why*. Release managers hunt for signal in a sea of noise. AI agents try to help but lack durable context. Documentation drifts. And the truth of the system hides inside thousands of commits waiting to be rediscovered.

**gitsummary** exists to fix this.

It turns your Git history into a source of living, structured understanding—something both humans and AI can rely on. By automatically generating semantic metadata for every commit and storing it in Git Notes, gitsummary makes the repository self-descriptive. A codebase that once whispered its intent now *speaks clearly*.

Instead of raw diffs, you get meaning: purpose, intent, architectural consequences, risk, deployment impact, user-facing behavior. These summaries become durable artifacts used for docs, changelogs, audits, onboarding, and automated tooling. Documentation stays aligned with code. Release notes stop being guesswork. AI agents share context, not hallucinations.

Developers, architects, SREs, and CI systems all read from the same source of truth: the code itself—enriched, structured, permanent.

**gitsummary is the foundation of the AI-augmented repository.**  
A simple CLI. Zero workflow changes. Maximum clarity.

Your codebase already knows its story.  
**gitsummary lets it tell it.**
