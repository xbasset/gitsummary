technical_highlights:
- Adds docs/spec.md describing the envisioned behavior of the gitsummary CLI, including
  commands (`collect`, `analyze`), artifact schema sections (context, intention, implementation,
  impact, maintainability, deployment, meta), and Git-native storage design (blob
  OID as canonical ID, refs/gitsummary/main, optional refs/notes/gitsummary).
- Introduces workdir/spec-open-questions.md capturing unresolved design decisions
  around git range semantics, artifact identity and determinism, storage behavior,
  collector behavior, analyzer architecture, and deployment facet specifics.
- No source code, configuration, or public API is added or modified; the change is
  purely documentation and planning.
