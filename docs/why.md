# gitsummary — Goals, Motivations & Target Users

## Goals
- Automatically extract a structured, semantic understanding of what changed between two releases or commit ranges using only Git data.
- Capture developer intention behind changes—even when commit messages are poor or inconsistent.
- Produce a durable, reusable artifact representing the change set for documentation, QA, deployment, release management, and future introspection.
- Support multiple analysis facets (e.g., deployment impact, maintainability, user-facing impact) through LLM-driven interpretation.
- Make the code “speak for itself”: infer purpose, strategy, and consequences of changes directly from diffs, structure, and blame metadata.
- Provide clean CLI usability integrated into developers’ normal workflow.
- Store artifacts in Git Notes from day one so metadata travels with commits; during early development we also emit the same artifacts as YAML files for easier inspection and debugging.

---

## Motivations
- Teams frequently have poor commit messages (“fix”, “update”, “push changes”).
- PR metadata is unavailable or unreliable in many environments (self-hosted Git, no GitHub/GitLab API).
- Release managers and developers struggle to understand what actually changed between releases.
- Existing tools produce raw diffs, not semantic summaries or user-facing explanations.
- Developers want an automated way to understand:
  - before/after behavior
  - impact on users
  - risk and maintainability signals
  - deployment and monitoring implications
- Organizations need project-level metadata generated automatically from code history for:
  - changelogs
  - technical debt tracking
  - audits
  - architecture documentation
- LLMs can infer meaning, intention, and structure without ASTs or heavy tooling, enabling a simple but powerful POC.
- Bridge the gap between code changes and documentation so repositories stay self-explanatory.
- Enable long-term, incremental knowledge accumulation directly inside Git.
- Allow autonomous or semi-autonomous agents to operate safely and transparently.
- Create a simple infrastructure that scales to many agents and repositories while keeping complexity low.
- Improve development workflows without changing the Git commit model and lay foundations for AI-native repository practices.

## Users
- Developers (authors, reviewers, maintainers, new contributors) who need to understand what happened between releases quickly.
- Release managers who require semantic release notes or summaries.
- Tech leads / architects tracking architectural impact, debt, and ownership.
- Ops/SRE teams wanting insight into logs, errors, and monitoring changes for deployment.
- AI code assistants / agents (summarizers, reviewers, documentation writers, maintenance or refactoring bots) that operate on the repository.
- Project tooling such as CI pipelines, documentation or release generators, and IDE extensions that consume or publish summaries automatically.
- Teams without strict commit conventions, where automated semantic context adds the most value.
- Organizations across any Git hosting (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, self-hosted) where API access cannot be assumed.
- Projects missing documentation or onboarding material describing how the system evolved.
- CI/CD systems that want to auto-generate summaries or reports for each release.

## ✅ Explicit Goals (you stated or clearly endorsed)
1. Use Git Notes to store rich, structured metadata for each commit.
2. Keep project documentation in sync with code automatically.
3. Enable AI agents to understand, navigate, and maintain a codebase.
4. Provide human-readable commit summaries and explanations.
5. Create a simple, principled data model for commit-level metadata.
6. Enable agent collaboration through shared metadata attached to commits.
7. Design a small, clean artifact set (one ref, minimal schema).

---

## 🌱 Implicit Goals (inferred from discussions)
1. Create a new standard or convention for AI-augmented repositories.
2. Make the metadata durable, portable, and version-controlled.
3. Provide an audit trail and provenance for AI-generated content.
4. Enable semantic search, classification, and routing of changes.
5. Reduce the mental load for human developers (easier onboarding, clearer intent).
6. Allow multiple tools, agents, or humans to operate consistently on the same repo.
7. Keep complexity low so adoption is realistic.
