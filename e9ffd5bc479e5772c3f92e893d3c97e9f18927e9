intent_summary: Introduce pytest-based testing infrastructure, shared fixtures, and
  initial unit tests for the gitsummary commit analysis and CLI formatting logic,
  along with adding test dependencies to project requirements.

technical_highlights:
- Configured pytest via pytest.ini to discover tests under the tests/ package with
  test_*.py naming and to run with verbose output, short tracebacks, and DeprecationWarning
  filtering.
- Added a dedicated requirements-dev.txt for development/test dependencies (pytest,
  pytest-cov) and also included pytest and pytest-cov in the main requirements.txt,
  with slightly different minimum versions for pytest-cov between dev and runtime
  requirements.
- Introduced a rich conftest.py providing reusable pytest fixtures that construct
  realistic CommitInfo, CommitDiff, CommitArtifact, and ExtractionResult objects,
  as well as lists of these, to support higher-level tests.
- Created an initial tests package (tests/__init__.py) and at least one test module
  (test_cli_formatters.py) that validates behavior of CLI formatter functions (human,
  brief, JSON, YAML, and status formatting) using the shared fixtures.
- Established a structure that distinguishes between feature, fix, breaking, security,
  docs, chore, and test-only commits via fixture data, enabling comprehensive scenario
  coverage in future tests.
