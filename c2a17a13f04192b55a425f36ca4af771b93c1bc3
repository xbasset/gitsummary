technical_highlights:
- Rewords the goal about artifact storage to specify immediate use of Git Notes plus
  parallel YAML emission for debugging.
- Clarifies that developers want an automated way to understand behavior and impact,
  not just to "get" them, improving phrasing precision.
- Expands and restructures the motivations list to emphasize bridging code and documentation,
  long-term knowledge accumulation, agent safety, and scalable infrastructure.
- Collapses the previously separate emoji-labeled 'Users' and 'Motivations' sections
  into the main narrative, reducing duplication and making the document more linear.
- Refines the target user descriptions to explicitly include AI agents, project tooling,
  and a broader range of developer roles, while keeping the same conceptual audience.
